We've noticed that one of the mobile applications on an employee device has been sending some interesting data to the cloud. [Here's an example of one of the uploads](https://metaproblems.com/0d96db28b305a8f2504d7a9f9be044c0/phonedata.json).

The app doesn't have permission to see the user location ... but it might be tracking it anyway. Can you find where the user was when that data was recorded?
